        <h2 id="history" align="center">History of surfing</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">The first surfing references were found in Polynesia. Cave painting from the 12th Century show people riding on waves. In the course of seafarings, Polynesians brought surfing to Hawaii and the sport went viral. Surfing in Hawaii wasn’t only a sport but also an important part of the religion. The tree choice was vital and religious rituals were practiced during the surf board shaping. The ceremonies served as protection and to secure the gods’ goodwill. Everybody surfed – men, women, children, kings – but there was a strict rule system that regulated who could surf on which spot.<br><br>The first written heritage about the history of surfing was found in James Cook‘s diary, the European captain who not only discovered new lands but also surfing.
        The colonization of Hawaii began shortly after that by means of Christian missionaries. The approach of life has been remarkable beforehand but after the settlement it changed a lot. The Hawaiians had to wear clothes and to visit the church frequently and the kids had to go to school. Surfing lost its strong influence in this time but never vanished completely.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Big Wave 101: How the WSL Big Wave Awards Work<br><br>The WSL Big Wave Awards first launched in 2000, to recognize the surfer who rode the year's biggest wave. Now in its 18th season, the Big Wave Awards has grown to include seven categories.<br><br>Perusing hundreds of big wave submissions can be daunting, especially if you're new to Big Wave Awards. Here's what you need to know: Timeframe: The Big Wave Awards are open to all qualified surfers on all waves ridden anywhere in the world between March 20, 2017 and March 20, 2018. Nominees in seven categories are announced the last week of March and the winners are revealed at a gala awards ceremony in late April of each year. Who are the judges? There are three panels: One small group of professional surf photography analysis experts and experienced big wave veteran surfers who measure the tallest waves in the objective categories including the Paddle Award and the XXL Biggest Wave Award (caught by any means including tow-ins). The other subjective (or "gut feel") categories such as Ride of the Year and Best Tube are decided by a veritable academy of respected members of the big wave community, including all Big Wave Award competitors, photographers and videographers and members of the media who cover big wave surfing. The Overall Performance Awards are judged by a panel of 25 experts including past champions who follow the sport day in and day out and have an eye for ranking which men and women sent it the hardest at the most spots all year long.<br><br>How do they judge? The biggest wave awards use techniques which estimate the height of the wave relative to the known height of the surfer while factoring in the distortion caused by the photo's angle and lens size. The judges for the subjective and performance divisions are urged to consider sustained performance throughout the entirety of a ride -- including the overall quality and quantity of maneuvers or critical positions achieved -- and to evaluate the skill of the surfer in a challenging situation above the good fortune presented purely by the unique shape of a particular wave.</p>
